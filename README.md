This is some information about me!!!

## 
1.	Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?
   
One of the most significant challenges I faced and overcame was the passing of my grandmother during my testing and exam period. Everything happened at the same time, which added immense pressure and stress. I remember feeling emotionally drained for two weeks, struggling with depression as I tried to process everything at once. However, I overcame this challenge by motivating myself to stay focused and creating a structured timeline with clear goals. I also sought advice from experienced individuals who helped me navigate both my academic responsibilities and emotional struggles. Through discipline and support, I was able to regain my focus and successfully complete my exams.

2.	Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.
   
One project I want to mention is "Creating a Website from Scratch." My team consisted of four people, and our task was to develop a website for a client from the ground up. As a teammate, I actively contributed to the project, consistently met deadlines, and helped my teammates whenever they encountered issues. I strongly believe in the saying, "Teamwork makes the dream work," and I always strive to support my team to ensure our collective success. I know I am not perfect, which is why I continuously work on improving my teamwork skills. I do this by openly sharing my thoughts, actively listening to my teammates, and learning from my mistakes. By embracing feedback and collaboration, I aim to become a better team player.

3.	What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.
   
I believe I am most suited for a career in cybersecurity, specifically in penetration testing. I feel that I have a stronger understanding of cybersecurity compared to other fields in computer science. Growing up and studying in a Christian environment, I have always been driven by a desire to do good, protect others, and help people secure their data. Cybersecurity allows me to fulfill this purpose by identifying vulnerabilities, strengthening defenses, and ensuring that individuals and organizations stay safe from cyber threats. This combination of technical expertise and ethical motivation makes penetration testing the ideal career path for me.

4.	What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.
   
I would like to join the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) because we are now living in the age of AI, and I want to learn and understand more about it. I also believe that malicious hackers will use AI to create more dangerous viruses and malware. By gaining a deeper knowledge of AI, I will be better prepared to prevent and combat these threats. As a member of AAAI, I will stay informed about advancements in AI and explore how AI can be applied to cybersecurity. This knowledge will help me develop better security strategies and stay ahead of emerging cyber threats. In the next five years, I plan to participate in more cybersecurity competitions, attend workshops, and obtain industry certifications such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) and Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP). These experiences will help me enhance my skills and stay updated in the field of cybersecurity.

5.	What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.

I can use my cybersecurity skills to help prevent data breaches and enhance the security of both company and individual networks. In addition, I can volunteer by teaching and sharing my cybersecurity knowledge with the community to help people become more aware of cyber threats, scams, and phishing attacks. By educating others on best security practices, I can contribute to creating a safer digital environment and help protect those who may be vulnerable to cyber risks.
